- Not stand at your branch: To rename a branch you are not currently working in, you usually run the command git branch -m old-name new-name.

For example, Iâ€™m currently on the main branch and I was able to rename kolade-works to kolade-codes.

- Stand at you branch and change it: git branch -m new-name.
